Implementation of the FeedBack Adaptive Learning (FeedBAL) algorithm for the episodic multi-armed bandit (eMAB) setting.

# How to run
To run simulation I (no dropouts) and simulation II (dropouts), set DROPOUT_PROB to 0 and 0.1, respectively, in the "user_arrival_simulator.py" file and then run the "main.py" script.
